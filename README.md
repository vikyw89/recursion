    <ol>
      <li>Using iteration, write a function <code>fibs</code> which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of <code>8</code>, this method should return the array <code>[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]</code>.</li>
      <li>Now write another method <code>fibsRec</code> which solves the same problem recursively.  This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>In order to run these functions you’ll need to run it from somewhere. You can run scripts from the command line using the node command installed with nodejs. You can read about the common ways to do this <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.dev/blob/aa4239e87a5adc992fdb709c20aebb5f6da77f86/content/learn/command-line/node-run-cli.en.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

  <p>Did you figure it out? Congratulations! But do you really understand what is taking place? If you need some help understanding what’s going on with this method, give <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg-ddPbzcKM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khan Academy’s Stepping Through Recursive Fibonacci Function video</a> a watch. If you prefer to read, <a href="https://medium.com/launch-school/recursive-fibonnaci-method-explained-d82215c5498e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recursive Fibonnaci Explained</a> is also very helpful!</p>

      <li>Build a function <code>mergeSort</code> that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.</li>

          <li>Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).</li>
          <li>It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.</li>
